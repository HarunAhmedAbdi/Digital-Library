# My Digital Library Project!

Welcome to my digital library! Withing this project I have an app that has capabilty of using an api to make requests to a database of authors and books as well as books from multiple authors!

## Why am I doing this?
After learning Java from the QA bootcamp, my final project was to create a final project. I chose to make a library! The reason I am doing this project is to showcase what I have learnt over the past lessons. On top that I also needed to demonstrate what I have learnt to a capable standard.

## How I expected the challenge to go

At first i felt daunted by the fact that it was a final project. Anything final can be come with the conotaiton of being challenging. So I thought I would be challenged to a very high degree and expected to fail with the current knowledge I had.

## What went well? What didn't go as planned?

Within my project I can say the few things that went well were the planning and implementation of the database connection to the API.

However I can also say that somethings didn't go as planned. One such case is my idea to make a working front end with React js. I built the front end and was working fine but needed to connect to the API to make calls and as such couldn't refactor my code in time for the final deadline.

## Possible improvements for future revisions of the project

One improvement is that my project needs a proper working front end. With the front end I can implement all of my features and make my project even more amazing!

Another improvement is the use of more entities such as users so that I can allow my library to be used by registered users! And also make moderator users that have more access than regular users such as updating and deleting books/authors.

## Screenshots showing my postman requests and the output from the API.

Below you will find all of my screenshot for my postman requests:
